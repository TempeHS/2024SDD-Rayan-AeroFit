AeroFit is a beginner-friendly and simplistic step-tracking app made to help beginners reach their fitness goals. The application comes with three prominent features, a step tracker, fitness logbook, and a timed challenge mode. 

## Step Tracker 
### Core Features: 
- The Step Tracker used accelerometer data and time between steps to track user steps accurately.
- Step-Goal progress bar shows accurate progress towards goals
- Calorie conversions use a standardised ratio of 1cal:20steps to track calories
- Main page uses local storage to detect if motion-permissions have been activated. If not, it guides the user to do so, thus automating the setup process.

**Challenges I faced:**

I had to overcome numerous roadblocks when trying to implement this code. 
- My first plan was to write an algorithm that **uses distance for step-tracking using the GeoLocation API**. This method failed as the GeoLocation API **tracks displacement** from a single point of origin, which wouldn't track steps. _(E.g: Walking back and forth would result in steps going up and down)_.
- After that, I scratched my plan of using GeoLocation, and decided to only use accelerometar data to simplify the algorithm. This worked far better and was more feasible for this project.

## Fitness Logbook
### Core Features:

#### Submission Form:
- **Exercise Type Selection**: Users can select an exercises.
- **Distance Tracking**: Input for tracking the distance covered, allowing selections between kilometers and steps.
- **Additional Notes**: A field for users to add any notes about their exercise session.

#### Generated Entries:
- **Entry Creation**: Each exercise log submission generates a new entry in the logbook with the corresponding information inside and formatted.
- **Date Tagging**: Automatically tags each entry with the current date in a day-month-year format.
