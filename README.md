AeroFit is a beginner-friendly and simplistic step-tracking app made to help beginners reach their fitness goals. The application comes with three prominent features, a step tracker, fitness logbook, and a timed challenge mode. 

## Step Tracker 
**Core Features:**
- The Step Tracker utilises accelerometer data and time between steps to track user steps accurately.
- Step-Goal progress bar shows accurate progress towards goals
- Calorie conversions use a standardised ratio of 1cal:20steps to track calories
- Main page uses local storage to detect if motion-permissions have been activated. If not, it guides the user to do so, thus automating the setup process.
