AeroFit is a beginner-friendly and simplistic step-tracking app made to help beginners reach their fitness goals. The application comes with three prominent features, a step tracker, fitness logbook, and a timed challenge mode. 

## Step Tracker 
**Core Features:**
- The Step Tracker utilises accelerometer data and time between steps to track user steps accurately.
- Step-Goal progress bar shows accurate progress towards goals
- Calorie conversions use a standardised ratio of 1cal:20steps to track calories
- Main page uses local storage to detect if motion-permissions have been activated. If not, it guides the user to do so, thus automating the setup process.

**Challenges I faced:**
I had to overcome numerous roadblocks when trying to implement this code. 
- My first plan was to write an algorithm that detects changes in distance by using the GeoLocation API. This method failed as the GeoLocation API tracks displacement from a single point of origin, which wouldn't track steps. (E.g: Walking back and forth would result in steps going up and down).
- After that, I scratched my plan of using GeoLocation, and decided to only use accelerometar data via the deviceMotionEvent to simplify the algorithm. When I first implemented the code, it tracked motion, but it was too sensitive and detected even the slightest movement as a full step. The excess sensitivity made tracking steps impractical.
- I did some research into the deviceMotionEvent and found that you could include gravity into the equation (event.accelerationIncludingGravity). Just adding that to my code  improved i's accuracy. Furthermore, I learnt you could add a minimum time delay in order for a step to be registered. These two implementations alone cancelled out many false steps.
