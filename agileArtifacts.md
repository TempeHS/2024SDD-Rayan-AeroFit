# Agile Artifacts
## Sprint backlog list of achievables (annotate changes made during sprint, including data required)
1. ~~Use Accelerometer API to sensibly track steps.~~
2. ~~Use a basic calorie to step ratio to estimate cals burnt.~~
3. ~~Add a live goal progress bar that is synchronised with stepCount~~
4. ~~Add local storage system for Motion Permissions~~ (added so that user can be appropiately prompted to accept motion permissions)
## Increment (what must be achieved by the end of the sprint)
~~I must create an accurate step-counter that uses the accelerometer, it will be paired with an algorithm that aims to filter out non-step motions.~~
~~I must also use the step data to calculate calories burnt~~
~~I must also add in a bar that fills up in the goals box, to show user step and calories progress.~~



## Sprint Review (Focus on project management)

### What challenges did you have?
This Sprint took the longest to complete. This was due to the stress I had trying to learn and incorporate some of these more complex features such as step tracking. Furthermore, many annoying errors in my code and syntax lead to me putting off coding for a while.


### What did you do well?
I assessed my capabilites and simplified my step-tracking from one that pieces together geolocation and acceleration data, to just acceleration data. This saved me time, and ensured that I deliver code which I understand, making it easier to tweak/maintain in the future. Also, dedicating time to researching existing code online allowed me to identity issues in my codes syntax and logic.

### What will you do differently next time?
Next time I'll get help from peers, parents and my teacher for any complex features I decide to implement.
