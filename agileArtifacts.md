# Agile Artifacts
## Sprint backlog list of achievables (annotate changes made during sprint, including data required)
1. ~~Create a Logbook Page where users can view and input their daily notes and goals.~~ 
2. ~~Add a Date System for the logbook entries, printing the current date on each entry.~~
3. ~~Allow user to delete entries.~~ (Got rid of editing as I don't have time to research how to)
4. ~~Save entries to local storage~~ (Got rid of saving as it will take very long. Too complex of a task)
5. ~~Add error message with user feedback if user submits empty entry~~
## Increment (what must be achieved by the end of the sprint)
A fully functioning logbook page where users can track their workouts. It should be structured instead of just freehand note writing.

## Sprint Review (Focus on project management)

**Challenges:** The greatest challenge I had was saving log entries to local storage, and then loading the entries back up when the site was refreshed. It involved the use of JSON Parsing which was too complex given the limited time I have left. 

**What I did well** This time I actually sought advice from Linh since he had already implemented a logbook into his app. He sent me the resource he used (GeeksforGeeks), and it helped out massively, allowing me to speed through this sprint. 

**What I'll do next time** Next time I'll complete complex tasks ahead of time.
