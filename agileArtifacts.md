# Agile Artifacts
## Sprint backlog list of achievables (annotate changes made during sprint, including data required)
1. ~~Use Accelerometer API to sensibly track steps.~~
2. Use a basic calorie to step ratio to estimate cals burnt.
3. ~~Add a live goal progress bar that is synchronised with stepCount
4. ~~Add local storage system for Motion Permissions~~ (added so that user can be appropiately prompted to accept motion permissions)
## Increment (what must be achieved by the end of the sprint)
~~I must create an accurate step-counter that uses the accelerometer, it will be paired with an algorithm that aims to filter out non-step motions.~~
I must also use the step data to calculate calories burnt  
I must also add in a bar that fills up in the goals box, to show user step and calories progress.



## Sprint Review (Focus on project management)

### What challenges did you have?


### What did you do well?


### What will you do differently next time?
