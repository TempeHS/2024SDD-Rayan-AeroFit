# Agile Artifacts
## Sprint backlog list of achievables (annotate changes made during sprint, including data required)
1. ~~Add local storage system for stepCount and calCount~~
2. ~~Error messages force user to retry input until no error is detected.~~ 
3. ~~Add a help page with user documentation~~
4. (Add a live goal progress bar that is synchronised with calCount)
Not adding yet as it will clutter the screen with too much info. I will add a settings page where you can toggle this on/off.

## Increment (what must be achieved by the end of the sprint)
- ~~Local storage system that saves step and calorie counts~~
- ~~Prompting an error messages will force users to retry input~~
- ~~Create Help Page button that loads up user documentation~~

## Sprint Review (Focus on project management)
I created a schedule and was able to finish up this sprint incredibly quickly. I did an efficent job by reusing assets I had already created, (e.g the step/cal local storage system was a simple copy/paste from the local storage system I used for the user-goals.) The only real challenge I faced was with positioning elements, which took a lot of trial/error with tweaking and adding various lines of CSS. Next time I should seek proper research and assistance.
