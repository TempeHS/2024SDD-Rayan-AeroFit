# Agile Artifacts
## Sprint backlog list of achievables (annotate changes made during sprint, including data required)
1. ~~Design an app logo~~
2. Create a Goal Setup Page with three boxes. Two boxes for typing in numerical step and calorie goals, and a third for submitting them.
3. ~~Add Banner (New feature added  as it resulted in a better design)~~
## Increment (what must be achieved by the end of the sprint)
Aerofit logo to be displayed in the top left corner of the screen. Also the UI of the Goal Setup Page, along with functional input boxes where the user can numerically type in their goals. Additionally, their needs to be a way to submit that data, storing it in local memory.

## Sprint Review (Focus on project management)
### What challenges did you have?

### What did you do well?

### What will you do differently next time?
