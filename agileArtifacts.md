# Agile Artifacts
## Sprint backlog list of achievables (annotate changes made during sprint, including data required)
- ~~Add a challenge mode where users can try complete randomly generated challenges.~~
- ~~Make Step Tracking Active throughout all pages~~ (Made it active in neccessary pages_
- ~~Add user documentation to index.html~~ (Added as it was an important change)
## Increment (what must be achieved by the end of the sprint)
A challenge mode that allows users to generate timed challenges that vary based on difficulty.
## Sprint Review (Focus on project management)

### What challenges did you have?
Implementing the timer took a considerable amount of project time. I ran into multiple errors from the timer not working at all, to multiple timers running at once. This made this sprint unnecessarily long, in the future I will seek assistance from my peers, as they had already successfully implemented timers into their own apps.
### What did you do well?
I was able to incorporate gifs into my user documentation, enhancing the amount of information I'm able to convey to the user by showing them a live tutorial of what to do.
