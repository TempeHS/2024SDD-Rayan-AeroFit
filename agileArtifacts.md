# Agile Artifacts
## Sprint backlog list of achievables (annotate changes made during sprint, including data required)
1. ~~Create a Logbook Page where users can view and input their daily notes and goals.~~ 
2. ~~Add a Date System for the logbook entries, printing the current date on each entry.~~
3. ~~Allow user to delete entries.~~ (Got rid of editing as I don't have time to research how to)
4. ~~Save entries to local storage~~ (Got rid of saving as it will take very long. Too complex of a task)
5. Add error message with user feedback if user submits empty entry
## Increment (what must be achieved by the end of the sprint)
A fully functioning logbook page where users can track their workouts. It should be structured instead of just freehand note writing.

## Sprint Review (Focus on project management)
