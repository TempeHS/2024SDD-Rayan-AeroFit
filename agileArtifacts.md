# Agile Artifacts
## Sprint backlog list of achievables (annotate changes made during sprint, including data required)
1. ~~Design an app logo~~
2. ~~Create a Goal Setup Page with three boxes. Two boxes for typing in numerical step and calorie goals, and a third for submitting them.~~
3. ~~Add Banner (New feature added  as it resulted in a better design)~~
## Increment (what must be achieved by the end of the sprint)
~~Aerofit logo to be displayed in the top left corner of the screen. Also the UI of the Goal Setup Page, along with functional input boxes where the user can numerically type in their goals.~~
 Additionally, their needs to be a way to submit that data, storing it in local memory. (Cannot complete this increment as it is too big of a leap for the first sprint, it involves learning SQL databases. I will push it over to the next sprint)

## Sprint Review (Focus on project management)
### What challenges did you have?
Ensuring the input boxes were stacked on top of each-other took some time to figure out. The huge challenge however was trying to figure out databases on my very first sprint, and thus I had to push it over to the next sprint.
### What did you do well?
Successfully designed the app logo.
Created a Goal Setup Page with the required UI elements (numerical input boxes and a submit button).
Added a new feature, a banner, during the sprint as it improved the overall design.
### What will you do differently next time?
Assesss the feasibility of each increment before diving straight in.
