# Agile Artifacts
## Sprint backlog list of achievables (annotate changes made during sprint, including data required)
1. Create a Home Page with four boxes. Two which display amount of daily steps taken and calories burned. And another two which display the users step and calorie goals in order to measure progress
2. Create an on-screen navigation system which allows users to switch between the pages.
3. Create and attach relevant and simplistic icons for each element on the navigation system
4. ~~Error Messages (Added as they are neccesary)~~
5. Add local storage system for goals (added as they are neccessary)
## Increment (what must be achieved by the end of the sprint)
A fully functioning and simplistic navigation system. 
A home page that displays the users step and calorie goals, and a placeholder for the future step-tracking system.
Launching home page upon clicking the "submit" button, unless invalid input as then it should prompt an error message.
I also need a local storage system that retrieves and displays goals on the home page.

## Sprint Review (Focus on project management)
### What challenges did you have?

### What did you do well?

### What will you do differently next time?
