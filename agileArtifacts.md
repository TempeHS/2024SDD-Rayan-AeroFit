# Agile Artifacts
## Sprint backlog list of achievables (annotate changes made during sprint, including data required)
1. Create a Logbook Page where users can view and input their daily notes and goals. 
2. Add a Date System for the logbook entries, printing the current date on each entry.
3. Allow user to delete and edit entries.
## Increment (what must be achieved by the end of the sprint)
A fully functioning logbook page where users can track their workouts. It should be structured instead of just freehand note writing.

## Sprint Review (Focus on project management)

### What challenges did you have?
Implementing the timer took a considerable amount of project time. I ran into multiple errors from the timer not working at all, to multiple timers running at once. This made this sprint unnecessarily long, in the future I will seek assistance from my peers, as they had already successfully implemented timers into their own apps.
### What did you do well?
I was able to incorporate gifs into my user documentation, enhancing the amount of information I'm able to convey to the user by showing them a live tutorial of what to do.
