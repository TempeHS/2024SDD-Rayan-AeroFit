# Agile Artifacts
## Sprint backlog list of achievables (annotate changes made during sprint, including data required)
1. ~~Add maintenance.md~~
2. ~~Add developer documentation within code~~ 
3. ~~Make readme.md detailed and visually impressed~~

## Increment (what must be achieved by the end of the sprint)
Add final documentation for teacher and developers.
## Sprint Review (Focus on project management)
This sprint was simple, yet tedious. I had troubles learning markup language for my readme.md, however I overcame that by searching up some tutorials.
