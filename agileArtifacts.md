# Agile Artifacts
## Sprint backlog list of achievables (annotate changes made during sprint, including data required)
1.  ~~Replace current userdoc images with tutorial gifs.~~
2.  ~~Make the index.html tutorial gif a popup~~
3.  ~~(Replace current navigation icons with bootstrap icons)~~ Couldn't implement. Tons of errors caused after pasting code.
4.  ~~Replace NaN goals with "0" steps~~
5.  ~~Add user documentation for log.html~~
6.  ~~Add desktop incompatibility warning~~
7.  ~~(Add popup on first launch that explains navigation system)~~ (Changed to an image on user documentation page)

## Increment (what must be achieved by the end of the sprint)
An enhanced user documentation overall, that leaves little to no room for doubt/uncertainty within the user.
## Sprint Review (Focus on project management)
In this sprint I had difficulties swapping out my current icons with the bootstrap icons. Multiple display issues arised when trying to do so, and spending time debugging such a minimal change wasn't feasible at this time.
**What I did well** 
I sped through this sprint by copy/pasting assets I've used before. Such as headings and body text for the help page.
**What I'll do next time** 
Next time I'll request teacher feedback early on, so that display bugs like this don't end up cancelling the implementation of a feature.
